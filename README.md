### Cant forget Terry !!!
And with all my projects I can't forget the main mantra:

“An idiot admires complexity, a geniuss admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple, for an idiot anything the more complicated it is the more he will admire it, if you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write journals in Academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you're a genius” - Terry A. Davis

## What is TunedIn?
TunedIn is a music based social media which allows users to see the most recent in music news and lets them share there taste with others.

## What's in the Stack?
With TunedIn, the stack is designed with an emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, maintainability, and adaptability. This will allows us to deliver a seamless and consistent user experience across different devices while keeping our codebase clean and efficient. Below are the key technologies we will use:

- [**Ionic**](https://ionicframework.com/): We use Ionic for building a robust cross-platform application. Ionic leverages popular web frameworks like Angular, Vue, or React, enabling us to develop a single codebase that runs smoothly on both iOS and Android platforms.

- [**Angular**](https://angular.dev/): Angular is our chosen front-end framework, which excels in managing complex routing, reusing code components, and handling services efficiently. It provides a structured approach to building scalable and maintainable applications.

- [**Capacitor**](https://capacitorjs.com/): Capacitor is a key tool in our stack that bridges the gap between web and native app development. It allows us to compile our web-based code into native applications for iOS and Android effortlessly. The process is essentially as simple as running:

    - `ionic cap build ios`
    - `ionic cap build android`

- [**Pug**](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html): We use Pug as our templating language for its ability to integrate JavaScript directly into templates. Pug’s mixins feature is particularly powerful, enabling us to reduce redundant code and maintain cleaner, more efficient templates.

- [**Supabase**](https://github.com/supabase/supabase): We use Supabase as our codeless backend, this opensource alternative allows us to easily run locally and host live data.

Our tech stack is carefully chosen to ensure TunedIn remains a dynamic, user-friendly platform that evolves with the needs of our global community.

## How to get Started?
Just a heads up - these instructions are all written by a mac user, these may differ platform to platform. As a general pre-requisite it's best to read up on the [Ionic Getting Started Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/starting) to introduce yourself to a lot of the concepts I mention here, once you've done that getting started should be as simple as cloning the repo and installing all deps:
```
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Getting Started with Supabase
To set up the backend for `TunedIn` using Supabase, follow these steps. Adjustments may be needed for other platforms.

- Install Supabase CLI: Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, you can install the Supabase CLI globally via npm or brew: `brew install supabase/tap/supabase`.
- Log in to Supabase: Authenticate your CLI with your Supabase account: `supabase login`.
- Initialize a New Supabase Project: Create a new directory for your project, navigate to it, and run: `supabase init`.
- Start the Supabase Local Development Environment: To begin using Supabase locally, run: `supabase start`

### To run through Web Browser
Run through `ionic serve` which should load up a web browser window and give you the ability to live reload.

### iOS and Android
We use Capacitor to allow for cross-platform code, if you've used cordova this is quite similar, [Read about the differences here](https://ionic.io/resources/articles/capacitor-vs-cordova-modern-hybrid-app-development).

- Stop any instances of `ionic serve`
- Build the application:
  - Run `ionic build` to generate the www directory used for native applications.
- Copy changes:
  - Run `ionic cap copy` to copy native changes to Angular.
  - Run `ionic cap sync` to copy dependencies from Angular to native.
- Run the application:
  - If you've set up Android and iOS for command line execution, you can run:
    - `ionic cap run ios` (requires macOS with Xcode installed)
    - `ionic cap run android` (requires Android Studio installed)

If not then please follow the native guide for specific platforms [iOS](ios) or [Android](android)

### iOS
***Perform the steps mentioned above in [iOS and Android](ios-and-android) before attempting these steps***

- Open the project in Xcode:
  - Run ionic cap open ios.

- Select an emulator:
  - Choose an emulator from the dropdown at the top (select the most recent option; for testing, it's beneficial to try a few different options).
  
- Run the application:
  - Click the Run icon to launch the emulator.
  - A log will attach to your emulator in Xcode, which is the primary method for debugging iOS apps on older versions of macOS.
    
- To run the app on a local device:
  - Ensure you are part of the whitelisted devices in Xcode. If you are not set up, you can change this to your local team (do not push this change). For setup assistance, please message Liam for permission.
  - Enable developer mode on the device.
  - Connect the device to your Mac.
  - Ensure your device is using the correct Apple ID:
      - In Xcode, navigate to Signing and Capabilities.
      - Select your team from the Apple ID registered on your local device.
      - Select your device name and click `Run`.

Once you have run the app once through xcode it should be open to run through `ionic cap run ios` so feel free to only refer to [iOS and Android](ios-and-android) once this is complete.

### Android
***Perform the steps mentioned above in [iOS and Android](ios-and-android) before attempting these steps***

- Download Android Studio:
  - Ensure you have Android Studio installed. [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrKu2BhDkARIsAD7GBotK3xKCEYVuBPv5du3RbeW8YkFV9HKniZHXrY8TfGXaygf76vfWIjsaAuicEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
- Open the project:
  - Run `ionic cap open android` to open the project in Android Studio.
- Download required dependencies:
  - Follow any prompts to download necessary dependencies upon opening Android Studio.
- Select a device:
  - Open the device management panel, typically located on the right side of the screen.
  - If no devices are listed, you'll need to download one.
- Run the application:
  - Select a device and click `Run` to load the app on the emulator.

## Creating a Commit
Want to contribute? There's a few rules, a code base is only as good as it's organisation as soon, as you start losing track of aditions everything falls apart, the way we are attempting to tackle this is through a strict naming convention, the general convention is:

```bash
COMMIT_TYPE[PLATFORM](LOCATION): COMMIT_MSG #COMMIT_NUMBER
```

**COMMIT_TYPE** is the type of commit, which can be one of:
  - **feat** - Used adding features
  - **fix** - Used for fixing older code
  - **refactor** - Used for refactoring old code without any user facing changes.
  - **docs** - Used for writing documentation and adding comments into code (we will be following a lot of the standard [**JSDoc**](https://jsdoc.app/conventions)) this can be bundled into the squashed feature commit.
  - **i18** - Used for commits only altering translations, if these are a part of a larger feature.

**PLATFORM** is for platform specific commits, which can be one of:
  - **md** - Used for commits only effecting Android devices.
  - **ios** - Used for commits only effecting iOS devices.

**LOCATIONS** is for location specifc commits, this will be one of a prefined list, I'll update this acordingly.

**COMMIT_MSG** will be your standard commit message.

**COMMIT_NUMBER** this will be the issue number, **ALL COMMITS MUST ORIGINATE FROM AN ISSUE**, if no issue is raised - raise one.
